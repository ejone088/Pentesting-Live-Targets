# Project 9 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)

Description: This vulnerability was found in the specific urls of the salespeople in the website. Each salesperson has their own ID (a specific number) embedded in their unique url but replacing any of the existing numbers with an apostrophe causes the database query to fail, revealing that there indeed is a database where the information is stored. To be sure that a SQL Injection is possible, the phrase that replaces one of the numerical IDs seen below in the url contains the SLEEP command which causes the website to take 5 seconds to load and in turn makes it vulnerable to a Blind SQL Injection attack.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

Description: Unlike the blue or red websites, the green website's vulnerability can be found at its login page. Typically username enumeration can be found as a result of prompts by login pages when a username is correct but the password is incorrect. This can be confirmed when entering a username, that is not a registered one, and password then a prompt from the page appears but is different from the prompt it launches when a correct username is entered but the password is incorrect. This can be seen below as a correct username and incorrect password is entered and a bold prompt appears but an incorrect username and password being entered causes the prompt to launch but it is not bold, signaling the username is incorrect. This can be taken advantage of by brute-forcing this website or any website with the same vulnerability with the proper tools.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Description: Similarly to the SQL Injection vulnerability in the blue website, the red website's vulnerability was also due to the urls of the salespeople in the website. To be more specific, the salespeople have their IDs also defined by their own numerical values in their unique urls. As can be seen below, this access control vulnerability was taken advantage of by inputting the numerical values of "10" or "11", as a user, which revealed certain information about their salespeople that is not supposed to be accessbile/viewable to a regular user.
